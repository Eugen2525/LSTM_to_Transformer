# LSTM_to_Transformer

So you want to use Transformer as in Google's tensor2tensor library in your Keras project but do not know how? You want to replace LSTM bidirectional RNN to Transformer? Then above code is a helper to you.

Dependencies:

1) Tensor2Tensor library: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor
2) Keras transformer: https://github.com/kpot/keras-transformer

Happy using :))
